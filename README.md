# Arduino-Controlled-Robot-Car-with-Obstacle-Detection
The Arduino-based robot car obstacle detection follower robot is designed to autonomously  navigate while avoiding obstacles. It uses a radar unit to detect objects in its path and  gathers their kinetic attributes. The system sets a presumed object zone based on the initial detection, and then compares subsequent detections with this zone to track the object's  movement. The robot adjusts its path to avoid collisions using motor control mechanisms. This project allowed me to explore Arduino programming, sensor integration, autonomous navigation, and object detection techniques.Tech-Stack: Arduino Uno, L293D Motor Driver Shield, Servo Motor, Ultra Sonic Sensor, Dc Motor, Arduino Ide, Embedded C, Arduino Programming.
